Hello!
I am Chiara. I have an ENFP MBTI personality, Extrovert, Intuitive, Feeling and Percieving. So, you can tell that I am a very cheerful person, optimistic and adaptive person. I always want people around me have a great day, that was a reason that I want to take part in society.
I have a lot of things that I like. I like to sing, play instruments, swimming, dancing and etc. I would go to the beach rather than mountain. I am an independent woman who really loves my family.
